Building a Responsive and Interactive Web Page 
Scenario: You are tasked with creating a dynamic and responsive web page for a  fictional restaurant called "Foodie Haven." The restaurant owner wants a modern  and interactive website to attract more customers. You have been provided with the  restaurant's logo, menu items, and some basic content. Your goal is to design and  develop a visually appealing web page using advanced HTML (Hypertext Markup  Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) techniques, along with some beginner level JavaScript interactivity. 


Part 1: HTML and CSS (2 hours) 
• Create the basic structure of the webpage using HTML, including a header,  navigation menu, main content area, and a footer. 
• Add the "Foodie Haven" logo to the header and style it is using CSS to make  it visually appealing. 
• Design a navigation menu with links to the Home, Menu, About Us, and  Contact pages. 
• Style the navigation menu using CSS, including hover effects for the links. • Create a visually appealing layout for the main content area, which should  include sections for displaying the menu items and a brief description of the  restaurant. 
• Use CSS to style the layout, including background colors, fonts, and spacing. • Develop a responsive design using media queries to ensure the web page looks  good on both desktop and mobile devices. 


Part 2: JavaScript Interactivity (2 hours) 
• Implement a JavaScript function that displays the restaurant's menu items  when the "Menu" link is clicked. Initially, the menu items should be hidden,  and clicking the "Menu" link should reveal them. 
• Add a simple form in the "Contact" section that allows users to enter their  name, email, and a message. 
• Use JavaScript to validate the form input and display an alert message if any  field is left empty when the user submits the form.
• Create a basic slideshow in the "About Us" section that displays a few images  of the restaurant. Users should be able to navigate between images using the  next and previous buttons. 
• Ensure that the web page's layout remains responsive even when JavaScript  interactivity is added. 


Submission Requirements 
Submit the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files as separate files (e.g., index.html,  styles.css, script.js). 
Include a README.txt file explaining the functionality and features you have implemented, as well as any additional notes. 
Grading Criteria 
Your work will be evaluated based on the following criteria: 
I. Correctness and functionality of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components. II. Visual design and layout of the web page. 
III. Responsiveness to different devices. 
IV. Proper code structure and organization. 
V. Effective use of JavaScript for interactivity. 


Note: Students are encouraged to reference the resources used for assistance.  Plagiarism will not be tolerated, and original work is expected. 
Good luck with your activity!

The menu items  are categorized into sections such as Appetizers, Main Courses, Desserts, and  Beverages. You are expected to create an appealing layout in the "Menu" section of  the web page to display these items. Ensure that the menu items are organized neatly  and logically.
